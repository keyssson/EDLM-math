Official code release for the paper "Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation", accepted at *The 13th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025*.

## Guidelines

Checkpoints of pretrained Diffusion and AR LLMs can be downloaded at [here](https://github.com/kuleshov-group/mdlm?tab=readme-ov-file#checkpoints).

Save checkpoints to `checkpoints` folder, *e.g.*, `checkpoints/ar.ckpt`. Then you can run training and evaluation scripts in the `scripts` directory. We suggest you trying `scripts/job_sample_eval_owt_T_arebm.sh` and `scripts/job_eval_owt_T_arebm.sh` first, which don't involve any training.

More detailed guidelines for using this repository will be provided soon.
